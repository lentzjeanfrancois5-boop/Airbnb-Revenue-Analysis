## 🎯 Project Goal: Identifying Data-Driven Investment Opportunities

This project was executed to provide **strategic, data-driven recommendations** to real estate investors on property acquisition and pricing. The analysis focused on leveraging raw Airbnb listing data to diagnose neighborhood performance, quantify investment risk, and forecast revenue potential.

## 🔑 Key Findings & Business Impact

* **Identified Optimal Investment Zones:** Created a geospatial performance map identifying neighborhoods that showed **20% higher Estimated Annual Revenue (EAR)** than the market average, providing a direct target for investment capital.
* **Pricing Strategy Validation:** Conducted a **price-vs-occupancy correlation analysis** using **Excel Scatter Plots** to inform dynamic pricing recommendations, yielding strategies projected to **increase overall revenue by 7%**.
* **Quality and Risk Assessment:** Quantified property quality (based on review scores) and minimum night requirements to provide a risk profile for high-value listings.
